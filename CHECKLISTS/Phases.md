## Version 1-17: The Micro-Step Roadmap

### **Foundation Phase**

**v1.0 - Basic Thought Logger**
- Single `POST /thoughts` endpoint
- Stores thoughts in a JSON file
- Returns thought ID
- No retrieval, just logging

**v1.1 - Basic Plan Creator** 
- Single `POST /plans` endpoint
- Stores plans in separate JSON file
- Plan: `id, title, status: "proposed"`

[x] **v1.2 - Plan Status Updater**
- `PATCH /plans/:id` to update status
- Can mark plans as `in_progress` or `completed`

[x] **v1.3 - Simple Retrieval**
- `GET /thoughts` and `GET /plans`
- Returns all entries (no filtering yet)

### **Linking Phase**

[x] **v1.4 - Thought-Plan Linking**
- Thoughts can reference plan IDs
- `GET /plans/:id/thoughts` to see related thoughts

[x] **v1.5 - Plan Changelog**
- Add `changelog` array to plans
- `PATCH /plans/:id/changelog` to append change entries

**v1.6 - Context Window Simulation**
- `GET /context` endpoint that returns:
  - All incomplete plans
  - Last 10 thoughts
  - This becomes the AI's "memory"

### **Data Management Phase**

**v1.7 - SQLite Migration**
- Move from JSON files to SQLite database
- Same API surface, just better data handling

**v1.8 - Basic Filtering**
- `GET /plans?status=in_progress`
- `GET /thoughts?limit=20`

**v1.9 - Timestamp Queries**
- `GET /plans?since=timestamp`
- `GET /thoughts?since=timestamp`
- Helps AI get "what's new"

### **Human Interface Phase**

**v2.0 - Static HTML UI**
- Single HTML file that reads from SQLite directly
- Shows plans and thoughts in simple lists
- No interactivity, just viewing

**v2.1 - Read-Only API UI**
- Simple Express server serving basic HTML + fetch API
- Can view data through web interface

**v2.2 - Plan Detail Pages**
- Click a plan to see its full description and changelog
- See linked thoughts

### **Collaboration Phase**

**v2.3 - Plan Editing API**
- `PUT /plans/:id` to update title/description
- Add `last_modified_by: "human" | "agent"` field

**v2.4 - The "Dirty Flag" System**
- `needs_review` boolean on plans
- Editing a plan sets `needs_review = true`

**v2.5 - Agent Review System**
- `GET /plans?needs_review=true` 
- Agent checks this during context gathering
- Agent clears flag after reviewing

### **Polish Phase**

**v2.6 - Rich Text Support**
- Markdown support in plan descriptions
- Better formatting in UI

**v2.7 - Search & Organization**
- Full-text search on thoughts/plans
- Basic tagging system

**v2.8 - The "Endgame"**
- Real-time updates in UI (WebSockets)
- Plan templates
- Export capabilities
- Proper error handling and validation

## Key Development Principles for This Approach:

1. **Each version should take 1-3 days max**
2. **Never break backward compatibility** for the AI agent
3. **The AI's core workflow (POST thought, POST plan, PATCH plan) remains unchanged from v1**
4. **Database schema changes are additive only**
5. **At any point, you have a working system**

## What This Prevents:

- **v1-3**: Prevents getting stuck on database design before proving the concept
- **v4-6**: Prevents building complex UIs before establishing the data relationships  
- **v7-9**: Prevents scalability concerns from blocking basic functionality
- **v10-12**: Prevents interactive features before establishing reliable viewing
- **v13-15**: Prevents over-engineering the human-AI collaboration loop
- **v16-17**: The "nice to haves" that don't block core functionality

The beauty is that **versions 1-6 already deliver your core value proposition**: AI has context storage, humans have audit trail. Everything after that is enhancement.
